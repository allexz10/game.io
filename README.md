# A take on Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

This is a project I undertook to advance my skills using [React.ts](https://reactjs.org/) and other parts of its ecosystem. The game Rock, Paper, Lizard, Scissors, Spock is an extension of the original classic Rock, Paper, Scissors, which is used by all ages to settle disputes or just to have a little fun. For more on the game, it's rules and it's origin, visit the [Big Bang Theory - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock%2C_Paper%2C_Scissors%2C_Lizard%2C_Spock) fandom page.

## Rules

Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock, Rock crushes Lizard, Lizard
poisons Spock, Spock smashes Scissors, Scissors decapitates Lizard,
Lizard eats Paper, Paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes Rock, (and
as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors. Game up to 10 wins or loss of
health, good luck...
